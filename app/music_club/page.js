        The Music Club at Vazi is a versatile space for hosting concerts,
        parties, and themed events. Guests are welcome to propose events that
        reflect their musical preferences, whether itâ€™s an evening dedicated to
        the works of a favorite performer or composer, or a celebration of
        national music, such as Georgian, Russian, Ukrainian, or Belarusian, or
        any other. You can also suggest a specific musical style to shape the
        event.
