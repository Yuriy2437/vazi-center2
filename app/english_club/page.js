        The Vazi English Club is happy to help you brush up on your English
        skills and take it to the level youâ€™ve always dreamed of - all under the
        guidance of experienced teachers. Among them are both native speakers
        and bilinguals. In a cozy atmosphere, over a cup of coffee, we conduct
        1.5-hour classes on a whole variety of language-related topics and
        subjects - from Grammar to Phrasal verbs, from the Conditionals to
        Sequence of Tenses, from the Passive voice to Reported speech, from
        speaking to analyzing songs and movies.
